    This dataset contains a comprehensive set of variables, including temperature, humidity, occupancy levels, HVAC and lighting 
    usage, renewable energy generation, among others. Each record captures a specific moment in time, offering a detailed view of 
    the simulated environmentâ€™s conditions. The dataset is constructed to closely resemble energy consumption scenarios that might 
    be encountered in real life, making it valuable for examining the factors that drive energy use. It is well-suited for 
    activities such as exploratory data analysis and the development of predictive models, providing ample opportunity to investigate 
    and understand the various influences on energy consumption.
